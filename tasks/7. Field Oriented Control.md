Field Oriented Control
======================

So, now that we have working swerve code, lets use it for some fun, shall we?
Quite possibly the most useful improvement on swerve drive (something that basically every swerve team does) is field oriented control.
The idea is that instead of having "forward" mean "the front of the robot", "forward" means towards the other end of the field.
  
For us, we want forward to mean "top of the screen." This is actually reasonably easy to implement,
and should only require changing a few lines in the translational swerve section of your code.
  
All you will need that you haven't used before is `RobotInterface.getHeading()`, which returns the direction that the robot is currently facing.  
Note that it returns the heading in radians, positive counterclockwise, with `0` facing up.
Also, it will count full rotations in both directions, not just values between `0` and `2*pi`.
