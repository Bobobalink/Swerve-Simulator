Arcade Drive
============

Before we get into the fancy swerve business, lets get our feet wet with the simulation.
Just like the tank drive example, this drive will keep all the wheels pointed straight forward like a normal robot.

Arcade drive, like tank drive, uses two stick inputs to control the robot. The difference is that one stick controls
forward/backward motion, while the other stick controls robot rotation.  
I would suggest using the left stick's Y axis for forwards/backwards motion and the right stick's X axis for rotation,
but you can choose whatever standard you like driving around with.

This task should be a very simple refit of the tank drive example. Just like the tank drive, the most difficult part is
figuring out which wheels are on which side of the robot, and that's already done for you.

Think about how you move the robot around in tank drive. Specifically, think about how you make the robot turn in place,
and what happens when you transition from that motion to turning the robot in a larger circle (like turning while also driving forward).

You should be able to test this system on pretty much any robot chassis. Unfortunately, it doesn't swivel the wheels
so every time you turn, the robot isn't going to be driven well (why?). This is true for every robot except the `Two Wheeler`.


Since this is the first real task, I'm going to walk you through setting up a new robot controller and using it.
All you have to do is supply the logic that makes it work.

- First, make a copy of `src/main/java/RobotControllers/TankDrive` in the same folder, named `ArcadeDrive`.
It will automatically change the name of the class to ArcadeDrive. Don't change the logic of the class yet, make sure the setup works first.  
- Next, go to `src/main/java/ControllersAndRobots`. At the bottom of the constructor, there's a line that looks like  
`controllers.put("Tank Drive", new TankDrive());`  
This line adds an option to the "controllers" drop down box. the string in the first argument is the name that shows up
in the drop down. The second argument is a `RobotController` object, in this case a new `TankDrive` object.  
- Following this example, add a new line for the new Arcade Drive system:  
`controllers.put("Arcade Drive", new ArcadeDrive());`  
- Intellij should automatically add the relevant import at the top of the file, but in case it doesn't,
our new `ArcadeDrive` class is in the `RobotControllers` package, so you need to add `import RobotControllers.ArcadeDrive;`
- Now (re)start the application. If everything worked, you should have a new option in the controller drop down menu for your new arcade drive.  
Note that every time you change something in the code you'll have to restart the server.  
- Once it shows up in the list, change the code to implement arcade drive (as explained above) instead of tank drive
