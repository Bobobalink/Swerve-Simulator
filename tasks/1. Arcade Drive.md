Arcade Drive
============

Before we get into the fancy swerve business, lets get our feet wet with the simulation.
Just like the tank drive example, this drive will keep all the wheels pointed straight forward like a normal robot.

Arcade drive, like tank drive, uses two stick inputs to control the robot. The difference is that one stick controls
forward/backward motion, while the other stick controls robot rotation.  
I would suggest using the left stick's Y axis for forwards/backwards motion and the right stick's X axis for rotation,
but you can choose whatever standard you like driving around with.

This task should be a very simple refit of the tank drive example. Just like the tank drive, the most difficult part is
figuring out which wheels are on which side of the robot, and that's already done for you.  
Think about how you get the robot to steer while driving with tank drive, and then do the same thing in the code.

You should be able to test this system on pretty much any
