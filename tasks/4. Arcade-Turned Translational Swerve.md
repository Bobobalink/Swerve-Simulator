Arcade-Turned Translational Swerve
==================================

So we now have a working swerve drive robot, yay!  
Unfortunately for us, the drive team came back and told us they'd quit if we didn't let them turn the robot...

Making the swerve drive turn properly is hard, like I said before. For a start, let's just cheat and use the "better arcade drive" style turning we already have.  
The question is, how do we combine two completely different drive styles into one set of wheels?

The answer to that question is the surprisingly deep concept of "superposition". The idea is that if you have two solutions to a problem (how do you drive a robot?),
you can often add them together in some simple way to create a third solution to the problem. Even the original "better arcade drive" code uses this concept:
It has a "drive straight" part and a "turn in place" part and we just add them together. This task is just expanding on the "drive straight" part of the equation.

Control the turning part of the robot with the x axis of the joystick that isn't currently used as an input for the translation of the robot.

Once this code is done, it shouldn't surprise you to notice that the only robots that can be driven well with it are the same robots that can be driven well by the better arcade drive.
Superposition is the reason that the robot can be driven well when you are both translating and rotating.
