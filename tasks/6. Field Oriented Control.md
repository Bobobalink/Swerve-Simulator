Field Oriented Control
======================

So, now that we have working swerve code, lets use it for some fun, shall we?
Quite possibly the most useful improvement on swerve drive (something that basically every swerve team does) is field oriented control.
The idea is that instead of having "forward" mean "the front of the robot", "forward" means towards the other end of the field.
  
For us, we want forward to mean "top of the screen." While that may sound scary, it's actually not very much math compared
to what we've already done. You just need to rotate the joystick vector 'into the frame' of the robot. Draw some pictures.
  
All you will need that you haven't used before is `RobotInterface.getHeading()`, which returns the direction that the robot is currently facing.  
Note that it returns the heading in radians, positive counterclockwise, with `0` facing up.
Also, it will count full rotations in both directions, not just values between `0` and `2*pi`.
