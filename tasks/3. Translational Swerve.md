Translational Swerve
====================

Alright, we've been playing with boring non-swervy drives for long enough!
I advertised swerve drive, so here you go: the (vastly) easier part of swerve drive

We're going to make the robot drive around in any direction without turning. Turning in swerve drive is hard, so we're ignoring it for now.

Your task is to make `TranslationalSwerve`, a controller that uses one stick to drive the robot in any direction.
The magnitude (distance from the origin) of the right stick will control how fast the robot drives.  
The direction (angle) of the right stick will control the direction that all of the swerve drive wheels will face, and thus what direction the robot will go

If you're unfamiliar with vector math, here's a few hints:  
Treat the (x, y) values returned from the joystick as the 'top' corner of a right triangle. Another (non-right angle) corner of the triangle is at (0, 0)
and the two right angle legs are parallel to the x and y axes. The two legs have length y and x, respectively.  
Use the pythagorean theorem and the basic trig functions to figure out how long the hypotenuse is (the magnitude)
and what angle it makes with the x axis (the angle).

Remember that for normal math, 0 radians is facing to the right (along the positive x axis), but for our swerve modules, 0 radians is pointing up (along the positive y axis).
Note that all Java basic math functions use radians for input and output, not degrees. As such, all of my code will also use radians.
If you don't know much about radians, the jist is that 360 degrees is 2*pi radians, 180 degrees is pi radians. 

Because angles are confusing, it's pretty likely that once the code starts sort-of working, the robot will consistently drive in the wrong direction.
When this happens, resist the urge to just slap a minus sign or a constant angle addition to the math. Go back and figure out what's actually going wrong.

Remember to check this code on a variety of robot designs, every single one of them should be driven well by your code.
