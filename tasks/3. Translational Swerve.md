Translational Swerve
====================

Alright, we've been playing with boring non-swervy drives for long enough!
I advertised swerve drive, so here you go: the (vastly) easier part of swerve drive

We're going to make the robot drive around in any direction without turning. Turning in swerve drive is hard, so we're ignoring it for now.

Your task is to make `TranslationalSwerve`, a controller that uses one stick to drive the robot in any direction.
The magnitude (distance from the origin) of the right stick will control how fast the robot drives.  
The direction (angle) of the right stick will control the direction that all of the swerve drive wheels will face, and thus what direction the robot will go

We definitely want to be able to drive in any direction, not just in a few cardinal directions.

Remember that for normal math, 0 degrees is facing to the right (along the positive x axis), but for our swerve modules, 0 degrees is pointing up (along the positive y axis)

If you're unfamiliar with vector math, here's a few hints:  
Treat the (x, y) values returned from the joystick as the 'top' corner of a right triangle. Another corner of the triangle is at (0, 0)
and the two right angle legs are on the x and y axes. The two legs have length y, and x, respectively.  
Use the pythagorean identity and the basic trig functions to figure out how long the hypotenuse is (the magnitude) and what angle it makes with the x axis.

Because angles are confusing, it's pretty likely that once the code starts sort-of working, the robot will drive in the wrong direction in some way.
When this happens, resist the urge to just slap a minus sign or a constant angle addition to the math. Go back and double check your math to figure out what's actually going wrong.
