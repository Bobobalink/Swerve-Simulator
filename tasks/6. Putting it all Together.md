Putting it all Together
=======================

Now that we've developed translational swerve _and_ rotational swerve, it seems like it might be time to stick them together and make a working robot.

As you have hopefully guessed since I brought it up in the last "complete" swerve drive drive system we completed, we need to do some superposition.  
Unfortunately, unlike last time, this superposition is going to require my favorite, vector math!

Essentially, our Translational Swerve drive and our Spinning in Place drive each provide us with a _velocity vector_ that the wheel should have.  
This fact may or may not be obvious in your code for these drives. You might already have the x and y components of these vectors in your code,
or you might have to do some math based on the angle and velocity you send to each wheel module.
Either way, we're going to need the cartesian components for these vectors for each wheel from both Translational Swerve and Spinning in Place.

Once we have those, it's actually just a matter of vector addition for each wheel. Because of the magic of superposition,
adding these vectors together for each wheel will yield a working robot!
  
---------------------------------

So we did it! We got a working swerve drive! We're done! Right?
Well, sort of I guess. We have the bare minimum required to control a swerve drive at a high level.

From here, there are two paths that can be pursued:
 
First, and most important, is the low level of swerve drive control. Controlling the motors to make each swerve module
do what the high level code wants is non-trivial, and there are other practical considerations as well,
such as reversing the drive motors to minimize the time taken to physically turn the swerve module around,
and waiting for the swivel motor to complete its motion before trying to drive in the new direction.  
Unfortunately, This simulator does not even come close to the fidelity required to tackle these problems. At least for now,
these questions will have to be addressed on real robot hardware.

Second, there are many more ways to ~~skin a cat~~ control a swerve drive. The next few tasks provide different and interesting methods
to control a swerve drive that range from very useful (field-oriented control) to probably not very useful (Back is the new Front).
Regardless of their utility on a real robot, they will all be fun challenges that will improve your understanding of swerve drive control and make you a better programmer.
