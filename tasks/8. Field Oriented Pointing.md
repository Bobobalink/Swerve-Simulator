Field Oriented Pointing
======================

Pretty far on the other end of the usefulness spectrum is Field Oriented Pointing.  
Basically, why should translational movement have all the field oriented fun? I want to be able to point the robot in a direction
by pushing a stick in the direction it should face!

Now, you already know how to get the angle of a joystick from translational swerve, and you know how to get the heading of the robot.  
So lets make the other stick point the robot in a direction! straight up on the stick points straight up in the field.

Unfortunately, there's a major snag hiding underneath this seemingly trivial task: you can't just tell the robot where to point!
We actually have to drive the wheels in such a way that it ends up pointing in that direction! This calls for some Controls! ðŸŽ‰

Controls
--------
Obviously we don't need the most impressive controls here. We're still in a nice universe with none of those mechanical engineering contrivances
like "friction" and "motors that aren't infinitely fast" and "wheel slip" exist, so pretty much anything will work.  

You definitely could use a bang-bang controller (go towards the target at a constant speed), and it would probably at least mostly work.  
Those are a mess though. They cause oscillation if the movement speed is set too high,
and take a long time to correct large errors if the movement speed is set low.

Alternatively, the gold standard for "cheap, fast, and usually good enough" is a PID controller (probably with some of those constants set to 0).
Like I said, this simulation is not accurate so there's no point in learning about PID properly for this,
but we can just use the P term and it will work pretty well.  
A Proportional controller sets the output of the system (in this case rotational velocity) to a multiple of the current error.  
The idea is that when the system is far away from where it should be, it will move quickly. As it gets close to where it should be,
it will slow down so that it doesn't overshoot. 


Practical Considerations
------------
First thing about my system that really annoyed me was that when the stick is near/in the center, the robot goes kinda wild.
That's because when the stick is in the middle, any small noise on the input will cause a random direction to be reported.
Instead, we should only update the desired heading of the robot when the stick has moved sufficiently far away from the center.
We can calculate the distance from the center with the pythagorean formula (I'm sure you've used this at least once in a past task).

Once your controller works, you'll probably notice a few problems. It will likely have trouble spinning in circles,
and will probably randomly do aggressive full spins when you try.  
Basically, that's because circles are hard...  

What happens when we try to cross from `2*pi` back to `0`? With a naive solution, your controller will freak out and spin all the way around
because it thinks we have a HUGE error all of a sudden. This is a major problem that needs to be sorted out.  
Remember that `getHeading()` returns a heading that includes full rotations of the robot, not just `[0, 2*pi]`.  
We're enough tasks in that I'm not going to give you the answer to this one, sorry.
