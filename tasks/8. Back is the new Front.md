Back is the new Front
=====================

The crazy mechanical mentor got really obsessed with the idea that "every side is the front of a swerve drive" and got the freshmen
to build a second identical front on the back of the robot so we only need to do at most a 90 degree turn.

To aid her slightly ridiculous plan, we've been tasked with changing the Field Oriented Pointing code to rotate the robot the minimum amount
required to make one of the two fronts of the robot point in the required direction.

Basically, we need to prevent the desired robot's heading from changing more than 90 degrees. At that point, it would be faster
and easier to spin in the opposite direction and use the other 'front' of the robot.

In this crazy hypothetical, we also don't really care to keep track of which front is 'active'. It's not *impossible* that
keeping track of that could be useful, but it is highly unlikely.

-------------------

Rather ridiculous and convoluted scenario aside, this is actually one of the more interesting problems all good swerve code needs to solve.  
In reality, this comes up when controlling the individual swerve modules: 
We need to know when it's faster to reverse the direction of the drive wheels! Just like our robot, swerve modules take
a relatively significant amount of time to turn, and mechanical yells at us when spinning modules cause belts to slip...
