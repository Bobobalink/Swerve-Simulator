Better Arcade Drive
===================

So last task we made an arcade drive, and it worked, at least as well as a drive that doesn't swivel the wheels can drive...

Or does it?

It turns out that with the right math, we can make a second robot design work. You might have noticed that the `Double Two Wheeler`
is even more contrived than a lot of the other designs. That's because it can be driven well with this drive, if you get the code right.

The math isn't that much more complicated, there's only one little geometric thing to work out to make it work.
Remember to draw some circles on graph paper to work it out, even if it's just to make me happy.

Here's a hint:

You'll need to use `wheel.getPosition()` to figure out the distance between the wheel and the center of the robot.
 
Name this one `BetterArcadeDrive`.

Once it works on the `Double Two Wheeler`, think about other robot designs it might be able to drive well.
What about more than 4 wheels? What if the wheels are uneven? What does a central wheel do?
