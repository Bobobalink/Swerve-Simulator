Better Arcade Drive
===================

So last task we made an arcade drive, and it worked, at least as well as a drive that doesn't swivel the wheels can drive...

Or does it?

It turns out that with the right math, we can make a second built-in robot design work. You might have noticed that the `Double Two Wheeler`
is even more contrived than a lot of the other designs. That's because it can be driven well with this drive, if you get the code right.

The math isn't that complicated, there's only one little geometric thing to work out to make it work.
I won't give you the answer, but here's a hint:

Also, `SwerveWheelInterface.getPosition()` will probably be necessary.  
Name this one `BetterArcadeDrive`
