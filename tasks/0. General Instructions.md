General Instructions
====================
Read this before starting on the actual tasks. It will provide necessary background detail and recommended topics/strategies to complete the challenges.

What files to modify when
-------------------------
In general, this exercise is meant to be done only in Java (as is tradition for FRC control systems). This means that
when doing the tasks, you should only need to look at and edit the `src/main/java` folder.
Within this folder, there are two folders and a java class:
- `interfaces/` contains the Java Interfaces that you have to interact with. Interfaces are basically enforced descriptions
  of how code must behave. For examples, `interfaces/SwerveWheelInterface` describes all of the functions that an object
  *implementing* `SwerveWheelInterface` will have. In the `RobotController`s you will write, you will need to call these functions
  and trust that they do what they say they do in the interface without looking at how they work.
- `RobotControllers/` is where you should put your robot controllers. It's not technically necessary to put them here,
  but it's nice to keep everything organized.
- `ControllersAndRobots.java` holds the master lists of available robot designs and controllers. Whenever you make a new
  `RobotController`, it will only show up as a choice in the drop down once you add it to the list in this file.  
  You can also add new robot designs if you want, but I don't expect that to be necessary.

If the website is too big for your screen (or you just don't like the scaling of something), you can check out
`static/constants.js`. This contains well-commented constants that the code uses to draw everything on the website.

The rest of the files are "internal" and really shouldn't be changed, and I don't see any reason for you to look at them.
`src/main/kotlin` holds all of the simulation logic for the robot, as well as communication with the web frontend.
`static/` holds all of the website code (HTML, Javascript, CSS) and all the images that this project uses.


Background Information and Prerequisites
----------------------------------------
While this is all theoretically a coding exercise, a lot of the hard parts you will need to figure out is actually geometry.
You definitely need to know how right triangles work. Both the pythagorean formula and the basic trigonometric functions (sine and cosine).  
Additionally, I did all of my math in terms of vectors (dot products, unit vectors, etc.). You should probably be able to do everything
without vectors, but vectors will definitely make your life significantly easier, so perhaps you should brush up on them.
Finally, knowing about circles is necessary. Figure out how a point (wheel) moves around a circle at a constant speed,
and what happens when two points are moving at the same angular velocity (revolutions per minute) but at different distances from the center.  

In general, I would highly suggest pulling out some paper and drawing stuff.
Graph paper and a pencil is the best way to figure out all the math you will need in these tasks.

On the programming side of things, nothing terribly advanced is happening. You need to know how to implement Interfaces,
and how to work with Lists. The tank drive example shows off how to do most of what you'll need to do.  
I will try to sprinkle in more interesting programming topics along the way, but they aren't the primary challenge of programming a swerve drive.

The Goal
--------
The ultimate goal is for you to learn all of the algorithms required to successfully control a swerve drive, given working
motor velocity and position control (getting that to work is much more difficult to simulate).  
 
Controlling a swerve drive comes down to making sure the modules never fight each other,
which essentially means that given the current motion of the whole robot,
each wheel is driving with the same speed and direction that it would be going if it was a free-spinning castor wheel.

Fortunately for you, the simulation makes it easy to see what each module should be doing and what it is doing:
Each swerve module is shown as a pointy square: the point shows which direction the module is pointing, just like the point on the robot body.
Additionally, each module has two arrows drawn on it. The yellow arrow shows the direction and velocity that each module is moving,
while the cyan arrow shows the direction and velocity that your code told the module to move. If the robot is being 'driven well,'
these arrows will always align perfectly.
Additionally, each swerve module will be drawn in green if it's driven well, and red if it isn't. The whole robot will
only be drawn in green if all the modules are driven well.
