General Instructions
====================
Read this before starting on the actual tasks. It will provide necessary background detail and recommended topics/strategies to complete the challenges.

What files to modify when
-------------------------
In general, this exercise is meant to be done only in Java (as is tradition for FRC control systems). This means that
when doing the tasks, you should only need to look at and edit the `src/main/java` folder.
Within this folder, there are two folders and a java class:
- `interfaces/` contains the Java Interfaces that you have to interact with. Interfaces are basically enforced descriptions
  of how code must behave. For examples, `interfaces/SwerveWheelInterface` describes all of the functions that an object
  *implementing* `SwerveWheelInterface` will have. Your code can only interact with these objects through the methods described in the interfaces.
- `RobotControllers/` is where you should put your robot controllers. It's not technically necessary to put them here,
  but it's nice to keep everything organized
- `ControllersAndRobots.java` holds the master lists of available robot designs and controllers. Whenever you make a new
  `RobotController`, it will only show up as a choice in the drop down once you add it to the list in this file.  
  Feel free of add more robot frames if you want to test something specific, but I would not suggest changing or deleting
  the ones it already has since most/all of them will probably be used in at least one task.

The only other file that I would expect you to modify is `static/constants.js`. This file just contains a couple of numbers
that control the drawing of the robot on screen, changing the scaling between meters (the internal units) and on-screen pixels.  
If it's showing up too big/small on your screen you can change these values.

The rest of the files are "internal" and really shouldn't be changed, and you aren't expected to look at them.
`src/main/kotin` holds all of the simulation logic for the robot, as well as communication with the web frontend.
It may be useful to read through this in order to see the math that is similar to math you will have to implement in the tasks.


Background Information and Prerequisites
----------------------------------------
While this is all theoretically a coding exercise, a lot of the hard parts you will need to figure out is actually geometry.
You definitely need to know how right triangles work. Both the pythagorean formula and the basic trigonometric functions (sine and cosine).  
Additionally, I did all of my math in terms of vectors (dot products, unit vectors, etc.). You should probably be able to do everything
without vectors, but vectors will definitely make your life significantly easier.
Finally, knowing about circles is necessary. Figure out how a point (wheel) moves around a circle at a constant speed,
and what happens when two points are moving at the same angular velocity (revolutions per minute) but at different distances from the center.  
I would highly suggest pulling out some paper and drawing stuff. Graph paper and a pencil is the best way to solve these puzzles.

On the programming side of things, nothing terribly advanced is happening. You need to know how to implement Interfaces,
and how to work with Lists. The tank drive example shows off how to do most of what you'll need to do.  
I will try to sprinkle in more interesting programming topics along the way, but they aren't the primary challenge of programming a swerve drive.

The Goal
--------
The ultimate goal is to properly drive a Swerve Drive robot. This means that each wheel should *always* be driving in the exact direction and velocity that they should be.
What that means in this simulation is that the robot should always be green, no matter the maneuver being performed.

You can visualize what the wheels are supposed to be doing by watching the yellow vectors.
Your goal, at the most basic level, is to make the blue (driven) vectors exactly match the yellow vectors at all times.
Each challenge will be clear when the robot is and isn't supposed to be green (driven well).
