Putting it all Together
=======================

Now that we've developed translational swerve _and_ rotational swerve, it seems like it might be time to stick them together and make a working robot.

We're going to need the surprisingly prevalent concept of 'superposition' to solve this one. Superposition comes up all
the time in math, physics, and real life, and is the idea that once you have two independent solutions to a problem (how do you drive a robot?)
you can add them together to make a new solution to the problem. In this case, we have the "drive in any direction" solution
and the "turn in place" solution, and we need to add them together.

Essentially, our Translational Swerve drive and our Spinning in Place drive each provide us with a _velocity vector_ that the wheel follows.  
Hopefully, this should be pretty easy to see in your code. You might already have the x and y components of these vectors in your code,
or you might have to do some math based on the angle and velocity you send to each wheel module.
Either way, we're going to need the cartesian components for these vectors for each wheel from both Translational Swerve and Spinning in Place.

Once we have those, it's actually just a matter of vector addition for each wheel. Because of the magic of superposition,
adding these vectors together for each wheel will yield a working robot!

This would be a *great* time to create some functions to organize your code. I created one function that calculated the
vector for the translational part, and one function that calculated the vector for the rotational part. Then, I made a function
that takes in velocity x and y, angular velocity (turning rate), and a `SwerveWheelInterface`. It automatically
sets the angle and velocity of the swerve module to make the robot move with those velocities. This will help you significantly in the next few tasks.
  
---------------------------------

So we did it! We got a working swerve drive! We're done! Right?
Well, sort of I guess. We have the bare minimum required to control a swerve drive at a high level.

From here, there are two paths that can be pursued:
 
First is the low level of swerve drive control. Controlling the motors to make each swerve module
do what the high level code wants is non-trivial, requiring clever control loops and a lot of tuning.
Additionally, there are practical considerations to take into account, such as reversing a wheel instead of turning more
than 90 degrees, and dealing with the fact that wheels can't turn instantly. The motor control part is thoroughly outside
the scope of this simulation, and the practical considerations are difficult to do, but I made it work (get to task 8).

Second, there are many more ways to ~~skin a cat~~ control a swerve drive. The next few tasks provide different and interesting methods
to control a swerve drive that range from very useful (field-oriented control) to probably not very useful (Back is the new Front).
Regardless of their utility on a real robot, they will all be fun challenges that will improve your understanding of swerve drive control and make you a better programmer.
